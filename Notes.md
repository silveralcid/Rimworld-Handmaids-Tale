Structure Recommendation
The "Christian origin" structure would be most appropriate for this ideology, as it aligns with the religious fundamentalist nature of the society.
These memes together would create the hierarchical, authoritarian, and religiously fundamentalist system characteristic of that society, enabling:
Strict gender-based social hierarchy
Religious authority and forced conversion
Group conformity and control
Slavery systems
Ritualistic practices
Social dominance mechanics
